## [Unreleased] — account-switcher branch

The fork's account-switcher work: log in once with every account on every
coding agent, see each account's rate-limit windows, and switch without
logging in again. Architecture and the facts behind it:
`docs/ACCOUNT_SWITCHER.md`.

### Added

- **Kimi Code, zcode and OpenCode adapters** with capture, switch, status
  and limits; **Antigravity** identity, health, keychain bridge and
  per-model quota.
- **`caam monitor` dashboard**: one column per rate-limit window across every
  account, `*` on the active one, Enter switches; failed rows keep their
  last good numbers.
- **Main TUI redesigned** as a provider tab strip above the selected
  provider's accounts, one column per window, the selected account expanded
  in place; responsive tiers by width and height.
- **`n` logs a new account in from the dashboard** through the provider's own
  login, then captures it under the account that signed in; a picker asks
  which provider.
- **`r` refreshes** the limits on screen and, when the selected account's
  token has expired or was just refused, its token first (Codex and Gemini).
- **LAST USED** is filled from the activity log; a dashboard login is logged.
- `limits` reads the active profile's live credential rather than its vault
  copy; shared window naming (`usage.WindowsOf`).

### Changed

- **Every switch re-captures the outgoing account first** and aborts when it
  cannot (`--force` overrides). One core, `internal/switcher.Switch`, is
  called by `caam activate`, `next`, `run` (and `--precheck`), `workspace`,
  `robot act`, the wrap retry loop, the HTTP API, the TUI and `monitor`;
  none of them restores a vault copy on its own any more.
- **A login is a logout first**: `internal/switcher.Login` vaults the
  signed-in account (or files an unknown live credential as a backup),
  clears the live credential so the tool's login has nothing to revoke,
  runs the login, and files the new session under the account that signed
  in. The dashboard's `n` and `caam add` both use it (`add` no longer files
  the outgoing account as `_auto_backup_` or deletes files around the
  keychain). The smart handoff no longer injects a login on top of a
  restored credential; the coordinator and `wezterm login-all` capture the
  signed-in account before injecting `/login` and refuse when they cannot;
  isolated `caam login` for Claude Code and Antigravity is refused on macOS
  while the keychain bridge is on; `caam watch` no longer files auto-named
  profiles.
- **One refresh gate, no timers**: `refresh.NeedsRefresh` (expired, or just
  refused) replaces `ShouldRefresh`, which refreshed valid tokens and refused
  expired ones. The daemon no longer refreshes on its five-minute timer; the
  pool monitor only tends cooldowns on its tick and its explicit
  `RefreshAll` takes expired profiles only; `caam refresh --all --force` is
  refused.
- **One vocabulary, "left, resets at" everywhere**: `provider.Label` names
  providers by product on every surface (Antigravity, Kimi Code, OpenCode,
  zcode, Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Grok, Cursor); the `limits` table,
  `--rank`, `--forecast`, `monitor`'s brief/table/alerts and `robot limits`
  say what is left and when it resets, like the dashboard; `ls` lists
  providers in the strip's order with LAST USED; `status` labels tools and
  moves never-logged-in ones to a footer; `which` knows every provider;
  `robot limits` returns real limits and `robot next` reads the activity
  log; the API's `/usage` `last_used` comes from the activity log (the
  probe time is `last_checked`). `limits --format json` is unchanged,
  pinned byte for byte.
- **Dashboard edges**: help teaches `n`; the export dialog names its
  directory and that the bundle is plaintext; empty states say "press n";
  the name dialog speaks of login; `l` moves right; the palette has New
  Login, Full Card and Search; the sync panel's `s` confirms in a dialog;
  the status bar honours `show_key_hints`.
- **Antigravity limits** resolve the Code Assist project via `loadCodeAssist`
  under the `antigravity` User-Agent before calling `retrieveUserQuota`;
  the empty-body call was refused with "no valid license (#3501)".
- Only providers with a captured account appear on the strip; an empty
  vault says how to get started.
- Profiles that hold settings but no credential are listed as
  `No credential` and refused by `Restore` and `caam activate`.
- Kimi's login is `kimi login` (device code), not the chat REPL.

### Removed

- The TUI's `b` (backup under a typed name) and `l` (token refresh labelled
  login) keys, and the three-panel layout with its provider/profile/detail
  panels.

## [0.1.18] - 2026-08-31

### Security — release verification moved to minisign (resolves #77)

- **Releases are now signed with minisign instead of cosign keyless.** The
  updater verified `SHA256SUMS.sig` against a GitHub-Actions OIDC certificate
  identity (`.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/<tag>`), which only an
  Actions run can mint — and releases moved off Actions permanently, so no
  release could ever verify again. From v0.1.18, each release publishes
  `SHA256SUMS.minisig`, a minisign signature over `SHA256SUMS` made with the
  maintainer-held release key (minisign key ID `1BBD79B28BF718D0`; public key
  `RWTQGPeLsnm9G7VFdFWkkcRi3wJK/PqsYxWC+oLNN74W9IjBxRU1Xu70`, embedded in the
  binary and pinned in the README).
- **Verification is pure Go and fail-closed** (`aead.dev/minisign`): a
  missing `SHA256SUMS.minisig`, a signature by any other key, or tampered
  checksums is a hard error — unlike the old path, which silently skipped
  verification on hosts without the cosign CLI. The archive's SHA256 is then
  checked against the verified `SHA256SUMS`.
- **Version-gated for compatibility**: releases `< 0.1.18` keep the legacy
  cosign verification path unchanged; releases `>= 0.1.18` require minisign.
  `install.sh` gained the same minisign path (with the key pinned in the
  script) and keeps its cosign fallback for old releases.

### Fixed

- **`caam update` can find its own release assets again** — resolves #75. The
  updater compared its version-wildcard asset pattern
  (`caam_*_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz`) against real asset names with `==`, which can
  never match, so every platform reported `binary asset not found` while the
  asset was plainly present. Asset selection now reuses the same wildcard
  matcher as checksum resolution ([`413cdd6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/413cdd6), [`21539da`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/21539da), [`c56b8ab`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/c56b8ab)).
  Note: binaries `<= 0.1.17` carry the broken matcher and cannot self-update
  out of it — upgrade once via `brew upgrade caam`, the install script, or a
  manual download; from 0.1.18 on, `caam update` works again.
- **`caam next`/`caam run` fall back loudly** when `--usage-aware`/`--precheck`
  hit a provider that doesn't support usage probing ([`9470ef0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/9470ef0)).
- **Claude onboarding state survives authenticated shallow profiles** ([`5469e53`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/5469e53)).
- **`caam doctor` no longer misreports transient Codex probe answers** as
  credential rejections ([`ce81e9d`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/ce81e9d)).
- **Codex login layer naming** for vault/shallow layers left on a revoked
  generation ([`1a9a76c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/1a9a76c)).

### Changed — safety

- **Rotating-OAuth credential payloads no longer replicate between machines by default** — first slice of #66. Claude and Codex subscription OAuth uses rotating refresh-token families (replaying a stale copy can revoke the whole family — the #19 incident class), so their profiles now default to a new `host-local` sync mode: `caam sync` still replicates non-secret profile metadata (`meta.json`), but the credential payload never crosses machines; each machine keeps its own grant. Gemini/OpenCode/Cursor keep the previous `replicate` behavior, unknown providers fail closed to `host-local`, and `_`-prefixed system profiles never propagate. Override per provider or profile via `sync_policy` in `config.json`; forcing `replicate` for a rotating provider warns loudly when both machines hold diverged copies. `caam sync status` (and its `--json` output) now report the resolved policy; metadata-only transfers are logged as `push-meta`/`pull-meta`. The full `handoff` lease mode from the #66 proposal is deliberately deferred.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **`caam run` is now a transparent terminal proxy** — resolves #74. The proxied PTY inherits the real terminal's window size at startup and follows it via SIGWINCH forwarding (new `Controller.Resize`/`NotifyResize`), the outer terminal enters raw mode (with restore on all exit paths) so keystroke escape bytes are relayed to the child instead of being echoed onto the output stream, and stdin is relayed verbatim. ([`0abb987`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/0abb987), [`78f7ba0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/78f7ba0))
- **macOS PTY reads no longer fail instantly** — the PTY master is not deadline-capable on macOS (kqueue refuses `/dev/ptmx`), so `ReadOutput`/`WaitForPattern` now share `ReadLine`'s poll(2)-based approach instead of `SetReadDeadline`. Previously every deadline-based read errored on the first call and the wrapped tool's output vanished. ([`0abb987`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/0abb987))
- **Claude vault profiles survive refresh-token rotation** — resolves #73. `ActiveProfile` matching now keys on rotation-stable account identity (OAuth `account` uuid/email persisted in profile metadata) instead of raw token bytes, a Claude twin of the Codex freshness comparison decides restore direction, and `ResnapshotOutgoing` refuses to overwrite a snapshot with empty-refresh-token residue — so activate no longer forces a re-login after every rotation. The per-installation `userID` is deliberately excluded from identity (it is shared across accounts on one machine). ([`63ca467`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/63ca467), [`4d2af22`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/4d2af22))
- **PTY child reaping is single-flight** — `Wait` and `Close` previously raced two `cmd.Wait` calls; the child is now reaped exactly once, readers report EOF promptly once it exits, and buffered output is drained on POLLHUP before EOF is reported (Linux previously dropped it). A known Darwin kernel race that can discard the final output of a child that writes and exits near-instantly is documented in `internal/pty` and absorbed by bounded retries in the tests. ([`f3228cd`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/f3228cd))

## [Unreleased] — since v0.1.10 (2026-01-21)

### New Providers

- **Grok Build (xAI)** provider support — resolves #57. Swaps `~/.grok/auth.json` (+ optional `config.toml`), honors the documented `GROK_HOME` override, extracts account identity from the login credential, and deliberately leaves the unaffiliated community grok-cli's `grok.db` / `user-settings.json` untouched.
- **OpenCode** and **Cursor CLI** provider support ([`8da7fa0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_account_manager/commit/8da7fa00fed1240aa664e05955fd8de83bce0966)) — resolves #8 and #9
